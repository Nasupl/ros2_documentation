"There is preliminary support for `tf2 <https://wiki.ros.org/tf2>`__ in "
"ROS 2. We rely heavily on tf2 in ROS 1 to manage data about coordinate "
"transforms, and we expect to continue to use extensively in ROS 2."

"Here's how to try it out. In each shell, be sure to start by sourcing the"
" ROS 2 setup file as usual (e.g. on Linux ``. "
"~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash`` or on Windows ``call "
"C:\\dev\\ros2\\install\\setup.bat``)."

"That tool will publish a static transform from the parent frame ``foo`` "
